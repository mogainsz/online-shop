   <p>
      La Boutique Cassée is an online shop selling books and blurays. The shop uses a
      service-oriented architecture with a customer-facing UI front-end, and a service
      back-end. The service back-end consists of two separate services and associated
      RESTful interfaces.
   </p>
   <p>
      One of the services is open to all, and allows the user to browse and search through
      the shop. It also allows a user to place and view comments on the shop, as well
      as to register at the shop. The other service is only for registered users and this
      allows purchasing of items. Registered users are required to authenticate before
      using this service.
   </p>
   <p>
      In this assignment, you will use local versions of the services and data. To this end,
      please download copies of the open service, the closed service, and the data first.
      You also need to change the <em>Web.config</em> files in the two services to point
      to the local location where you have saved the data.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <a href="https://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/CWS/CourseWorkService.svc/cwm?cid=BinDispatch&amp;cname=DataBC">
            Data
         </a>. Unzip the data and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\BoutiqueCasseeData</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         <a href="https://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/CWS/CourseWorkService.svc/cwm?cid=BinDispatch&amp;cname=OpenBC">
            Open Service
         </a>. Unzip the service and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\Open</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         <a href="https://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/CWS/CourseWorkService.svc/cwm?cid=BinDispatch&amp;cname=ClosedBC">
            Closed Service
         </a>. Unzip the service and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\Closed</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Now open the Web.config files in the two services, and find the line:
         <br>
         &lt;add key="DataRoot" value="C:/WebRoot/BoutiqueCasseeData/"/&gt;<br>
         Change the value field to reflect where you saved the data. E.g., <em>H:\335\BoutiqueCasseeData\</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         You can then run a service using the 64-bit edition of IIS Express. Example:<br>
         <em>"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8188 /path:H:\335\Open</em><br>
         <br>
         If you want to run IIS Express from a Windows PowerShell, you need to prefix the above command line with &amp;
         so that PowerShell can execute the command (rather than treating the command as a string):<br>
         <em>&amp; "C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8188 /path:H:\335\Open</em><br>
         <br>
         Test the open service by pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/help">
            http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/help
         </a>. The browser is expected to show the
         API doc you saw at <a href="http://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc/help">
            http://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc/help
         </a>. Stop the service by quitting IIS Express.
         <br>
         The 32-bit edition of IIS Express – <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express</em> – is not compatible with
         the supplied services. You should not therefore use it.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      Now start the open service using IIS Express. If the data and the
      open service are correctly set up, you should see a list of bluray titles when you
      point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/brlist">http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/brlist</a>.
      Note that the output shown in the browser may not be well-formatted, and in this
      case, you may wish to view the source to see the unformatted content.
   </p>
   <p>
      You can test the closed service using the following command line:<br>
      <em>"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8189 /path:H:\335\Closed</em><br>
      Test the service by pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8189/Service.svc/help">
         http://localhost:8189/Service.svc/help
      </a>. The browser is expected to show the
      API doc you saw at <a href="http://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc/help">
         http://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc/help
      </a>. Note that viewing the closed service requires authentication,
      and you could use the pre-registered user <em>bond007</em> whose password is <em>bond007passwd</em>.
   </p>
   <h3>
      User Authentication
   </h3>
   <p>
      Note that purchasing an item required logging in.
      When you developed the UI for the shop, you would have just directed
      the user to the purchase link and let the browser take care of the
      authentication. This is not an ideal solution. What you would want
      to do is to have a login section and direct the user to it
      when a user wants to buy anything (and if the user is not
      already logged in). The login section would collect the user's
      credentials (username and password) and use the credentials
      when making a purchase request to the server backend.
   </p>
   <div style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;">
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">
         xhr.open("GET", uri, true, <u>username, password</u>);<br>
         <u>xhr.withCredentials = true;</u><br>
      </span>
   </div>
   <p>
      XHR would allow passing user name and password only if the origins
      match – i.e., the script that invokes the XHR and the URI
      the XHR tries to reach should have the same origin.
   </p>
   <p>
      Now that you have access to the closed service, you can publish
      your UI at the same location, and have the login section
      implemented the way it should be (i.e., collect the user's
      credentials and use the credentials with XHR
      when making a purchase request).
      Extend the UI you developed in the first assignment to incorporate 
      this login logic.
   </p>
   <div style="border: 1px dashed;">
      <p>
         If you have not done the first assignment, you can implement a shorter
         version of the shop that allows purchasing a single bluray title.
         This shop should have a minimal home section and a login section that
         successfully and elegantly demonstrates the login process.
      </p>
      <div style="border: 1px solid blue; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;
        background-color: lightblue; color: blue; width: 90%; margin: auto;">

      Please note the following requirements.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         You are <em>not</em> allowed to use any libraries or frameworks.
      </li>
      <li>
         You cannot submit any images. However, you could hot-link images from other sources, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
         The application should contain a single HTML page (named <em>UPI.html</em> where <em>UPI</em> is your UPI).
      </li>
      <li>
         The application should work on any modern browser (such as Chrome, Safari and Edge).
      </li>
      <li>
         The application should work on small screen devices.
         You can test this by making your browser window narrow.

   <h3>
      Pen-Testing the Service
   </h3>
   <p>
      It is thought the service has a number of vulnerabilities. You are now asked to
      penetration-test the service, and report your findings. You will first assume the
      role of a network user who is able connect to the service with the view of injecting
      code. You will then assume the role of a co-located user with access to the data
      to give more insight into further potential vulnerabilities.
   </p>
   <p>
      Note that if you corrupt the data during your pen-testing, you can reinstate
      a fresh copy from what you originally downloaded.
   </p>
   <p>
      The backend services cache the output data for performance reasons.
      If you corrupt the data, you may also need to re-start the services to
      clear the server cache. Similarly, a browser may cache data, again
      for performance reasons. So you may also need to clear the browser cache.
      Browser caches typically are persistent. Consequently, re-starting the
      browser is not likely to clear its cache. You need to look at the browser
      settings to find out how to clear its cache.
   </p>
   <p>
      You may find it helpful to use the UI you developed for Assignment 1. This will require
      you to change the service URLs in your UI implementation to point to the local services.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please answer the questions below, first assuming the role of a network user, and
      then assuming the role of a co-located user. Where the questions require you to
      write an HTTP request, please provide a URL if the request is GET; if the request
      is POST, please provide the complete request including all the necessary HTTP headers.
      E.g.,
   </p>
   <div style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;">
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">
         POST http://www.site.org/foo.cgi?t=Find HTTP/1.1<br>

         How many bluray titles are available in the store?
      </dd>
      <dt>N03</dt>
      <dd>
         Find out where SQL injection is possible within the service APIs. Write down an
         HTTP request that injects SQL.
      </dd>
      <dt>N04</dt>
      <dd>
         Find out where HTML injection is possible within the service APIs. Write down an
         HTTP request that injects HTML.
      </dd>
      <dt>N05</dt>
      <dd>
         Using HTML injection above, write down an HTTP request that inserts an arbitrary
         image into the UI you constructed.
      </dd>
      <dt>N06</dt>
      <dd>
         Write down an HTTP request that leads to executing a user-supplied script.
      </dd>
      <dt>N07</dt>
      <dd>
         The services do not stop cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Describe in
         a single sentence how a cross-site request forgery attack could be mounted on the
         service.
      </dd>
      <dt>N08</dt>
      <dd>
         Combine the CSRF vulnerability you found above in N07 and the XSS vulnerability you
         mentioned in N06 in an HTTP request. Write this request down.
      </dd>
   </dl>
   <h4>
      Co-Located User
   </h4>
   <p>
      Assume now the role of a co-located user, and answer the following questions. This
      will require you to study the data used by the services. Note that if you corrupt
      the data during your pen-testing, you can reinstate a fresh copy from what you originally
      downloaded.
   </p>
   <dl>
      <dt>C01</dt>
      <dd>
         Open the database file using a binary editor (e.g., <a href="http://frhed.sourceforge.net/en/">
            frhed
         </a> on Windows or <a href="http://www.suavetech.com/0xed/">0xED</a> on
         MacOS). Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29">
            magic number
         </a> in the file to find out the name of the database management
         system. Write down the name of this database management system.
      </dd>
      <dt>C02</dt>
      <dd>
         Get a tool that is able to open the contents of the above database, and examine
         the contents of the database using this tool. How many tables exist in the database?
         (Note that you can download both Windows and MacOS versions of the tool.)
      </dd>
      <dt>C03</dt>
      <dd>
         One of the tables in the database contains user credentials. There are two users
         in the supplied database, one is <em>bond007</em>, what is the name of the other?
      </dd>
      <dt>C04</dt>
      <dd>
         Find out the password of the user you mentioned in <em>C03</em> above. The password
         is thought to be a common dictionary word. For example, you can find a list of commonly
         used words <a href="http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp">here</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>C05</dt>
      <dd>
         In the data pack the service uses, there is a folder called <em>BluraysBig</em>,
         and the service does not publish any of the images from this folder. Craft an HTTP request
         that can still give a network user access to one of the images in this folder. Write
         down this HTTP request.
      </dd>
